## This is my markdown

I can put anything here and it will be rendered as HTML in the browser. How cool is that!

```py
"Code blocks don't work that nicely because <pre> isn't implemented yet. "

"Syntax highlighting and whitespace preservation isn't there yet either. "
```

But hot reload on markdown.md works. Just try it out!
