# Contributing

Firstly, any contributions are welcome: Raising issues, asking or answering questions, submitting pull requests, requesting awesome features. Anything. 

If you want to contribute and change the Positron code base then it might make sense to install Positron in editable mode with all dependencies. This will allow you to run all examples and tests and auto format the code

```shell
pip install -e .[all]
```

If you need any help understanding anything, that is totally normal and you should be able to ask any questions you have. 
For this, you can either use the ![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Positron-Contributors/community](https://badges.gitter.im/Positron-Contributors/community.svg) or [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/Positron/discussions)

## Security Issues

If you find any security issues, please submit them privately on the GitHub repos security tab. 

At the moment, the only real security issues are when something is automatically loaded from the web that could be harmful.

Still, any advice is extremely helpful and greatly appreciated.
